# Stock Market Price Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

This project is a Streamlit-based web app for predicting stock prices using historical data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Features

- Fetches 10 years of historical stock data using [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).
- Visualizes the closing price history.
- Trains an LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- Displays predictions and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- Provides the next day's predicted stock price.

## Usage

1. Enter a stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple, `RELIANCE.NS` for Reliance Industries).
2. View historical stock data and a visualization of closing prices.
3. Train the LSTM model to make predictions.
4. View predictions compared to actual values.
5. Get the predicted price for the next day.
